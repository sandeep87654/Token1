Contract Definition

contract MyToken {
…
}
This defines a new contract called MyToken.

Public Variables

string public TokenName = "luffy";
string public TokenAbbrv = "zoro";
uint256 public totalSupply = 0;
These are three public variables that store information about the token:

TokenName: a string variable that stores the name of the token, initialized to "luffy".
TokenAbbrv: a string variable that stores the abbreviation of the token, initialized to "zoro".
totalSupply: a uint256 variable that stores the total supply of tokens, initialized to 0.
Mapping

mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
This defines a public mapping called balances that maps an Ethereum address to a uint256 value. This mapping will be used to store the balance of tokens for each address.

Mint Function

function mint(address _address, uint256 _amount) public {
totalSupply += _amount;
balances[_address] += _amount;
}
This is a public function called mint that takes two parameters:

_address: the Ethereum address to which the tokens will be minted.
_amount: the number of tokens to be minted.
The function does the following:

Increments the totalSupply by _amount.
Increments the balance of the _address in the balances mapping by _amount.
Burn Function

function burn(address _address, uint256 _amount) public {
if (balances[_address] >= _amount) {
totalSupply -= _amount;
balances[_address] -= _amount;
}
}
This is a public function called burn that takes two parameters:

_address: the Ethereum address from which the tokens will be burned.
_amount: the number of tokens to be burned.
The function does the following:

Checks if the balance of the _address in the balances mapping is greater than or equal to _amount. If true, then:
Decrements the totalSupply by _amount.
Decrements the balance of the _address in the balances mapping by _amount.
Note that the if statement is used to prevent burning more tokens than the address has in its balance.
